# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Overview of the project:

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

## Analysis and Challenges:

### Monthly Results by Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

* Monthly Results by Theater Outcomes by Lauch Date Table

Louised Play Fever fundraising goals data collected and analyzed by allows to concluded with the following investigated dataset. The Project has a fair rate of successful outcomes as compared against failed and canceled events by Launch Date. This Analysis determine that the months of May and June had the most Successful events rate per month. However, by the month of July the play Fever fundraising event started to have a decreased in Successful plays until it reach the month of December where the Successful rate almost reach the even point with failed events by just having a difference of 2 successful events. This research shows that the management involved of supporting the play should have made the necessary changes to prevent the successful events from droping.

Moreover, the month of December can be consider a near lost of operational support and funding revevue due that the play had only two successful events at this point the management has to seriously considered some implementation or changes to increased the succesful rate of plays and revenue for the fundraising. As it can be seeing in the line graph below.

As you can see in the line graph below the exponential increased in successful rates for the month of may and June. Lastly, The graph shows of that the total successful rate for the project was approximately 61.29%, total failure rate was approximately 36.01%, and a canceled rate approximately of .03%. 

## Conclusion

Based on the dataset gather from the Louise’s play "Fever" with can see that the project started well at the beginning of January to reached its highest point in the months of May and June. However, the succesful rate of play for the fundraising project began to fade away with the increase of failure rates to the point of reaching the highest failure rate in the month of December. Overall this project can be consider fair enough successful becuase it kept the successful rate at 61.29% but it did not pass the 80% rate. Base on the theory of pareto principle 80/ 20 in which the 20% input should output 80%. this is a theory of efficiency and it helps to track the rate of efficenty and quality to determine if a project was successful or if there is anything to implement in the project that will increase the sucessful rate on the next funraising. We suggested to Louise’s play Fever fundraising program to implement and make the necessary changes for their next project to ensure the 80% or higher of successful rate.

The examine above dataset shows an alarming result based on the outcome, goals, and plays dataset. This dataset shows a similarity between the two line graphs. The above graph is showing the failure rate to surpass the successful plays. This dataset would required Louised Play Fever fundraising management team to make the necessary changes and implementation for the next project. The object for the management team is to prevent the constant spikes of failure rate but to keep it under control a stable rate less than the 10% output total. 

## Conclusion

This graph shows a high rate of success as well as activity from the $1000 or between $30,000 to $40,000 range. As a result it can be suggested base on this result that the project should keep and create several low bugget campaings based on the dataset gather in this research. 


## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

This dateset was fairly challengening to gather utilize the appropite formulas for the combination of ranges and arguntes for the requirements ask in this challenge during delivery.

## Results

### Conclusion for Outcomes based on Launch Date

*  Succesful rate percentages should be analyze during the campaign timeline. Due that sharp drops of successful rates and spikes of failure rate should be monitor to make the necessary adjusments to support the vision and objective of the client. 

*   Due to the high rate of failed events. Quality control surveys should me included in the dataset to have a better understing of that cause the increase of the failure rates.

### Conclusion for Outcomes based on Goals

* Based on the given result from this dataset the success of the project got overshadow by the spike of number of failures. This would required management to included multiple surveys for quality and control from the successful, failed, and canceled events.

## Limitations of Dataset 

This dataset would need more surveys and data to come with more in deep conclusion of trends, spikes, outlayer data set, or other concepts that are important to provide a well structure data analysis. In addition, the reliability of this dataset factors such as human error, bias inputs, missing dataset, and other concepts should be consider and analysis to proivde the best possible solution for the need of the client. It is recommended to have quality control dataset to determine the reasons for the successful rates as well for the failure rates.
